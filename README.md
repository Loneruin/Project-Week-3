# Final-Project-Statistical-Modelling-with-Python

## Project/Goals
Create the New York bike station dataframe from CityBikes API then join with restaurant dataframe which is from Foursquare API

Goal: 

1. Practice retrieve data from API

2. Cleaning and analyze data

3. Visualize data to find pattern

## Process
### 1.Retrieve data from API
### 2.Clean data
### 3. Compare between two different API supplier
### 4. Join data and analyze to find pattern


## Results
It is pretty challenging to give any conclusion to the data due to a lack of values. However, in my opinion, there is a correlation between the popularity and rating of the restaurants which are near the bike station location

## Challenges 
1. This is my first time doing the project so it is hard to figure out where to start

2. I have to pick the data carefully because some data will not have enough information to analyze

3. At first I'm using bike station API from Russia. However, there is not enough data so I have to start all over again

4. There are lots of Null values in the data

## Future Goals
If I have more time, I will try to find another API supplier and have a better data

I will review my lecture more so I can have a better result
